# 🌺 OrchidApp Version 1. 
An E-Commerce platform selling beauty products.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python Django (Database models, APIs, Authentication, etc.)
- **Frontend:** ReactJS, JavaScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Stripe, HubSpot, AWS S3

## 🌟 Purpose
This app was created to streamline the business operations of a beauty brand and move it from Instagram to a fully-fledged e-commerce platform. It’s designed to handle **account management**, **product purchasing**, **order complaints**, and seamless **customer service** integration. 

I designed the entire system from the **database architecture**, **models**, **APIs**, to the **frontend design** and **third-party integrations**. Now that the project has been handed off to another team of developers, I am excited to share the earlier version here! 🎉

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Account creation & mailing service:** New users can create accounts and receive welcome emails.
- **Cart and Checkout:** Add products to your cart and complete the purchase process through **Stripe** payments. 💳
- **Complaint submission:** Users can submit complaints about orders, attach images, and the complaint is uploaded to an **S3 bucket**. 🚚
- **HubSpot Integration:** Complaints auto-generate tickets on the **HubSpot dashboard** for customer service tracking. 🛠️

This project also integrates various services to ensure smooth functionality, including a **mailing service** for account creation and **payment handling** via **Stripe**.

Note: This is a slightly older version of the application to protect the current version being used by the company. As such, many features may not run fully as I've had to hide some functionality related to them.
